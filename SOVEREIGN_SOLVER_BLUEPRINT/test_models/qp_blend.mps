* INDUS-OPT demo instance - a small convex QP.
*
* Illustrative, not a claim about real MRPL blending economics: two intermediate streams,
* LN and HN, must blend to a fixed 100 kbbl/day pool. Running each stream's throughput has
* a strictly convex (quadratic) processing cost - a proxy for the nonlinear energy cost of
* running a compressor or heater away from its design point - so, unlike every other model
* in this demo, the objective cannot be written as a linear function of the variables.
*
* minimize    0.01 LN^2 + 0.02 HN^2
* subject to  LN + HN = 100,           0 <= LN, HN <= 100
*
* QUADOBJ stores Q_ii, and the engine's objective is c'x + 0.5 x'Qx (see
* include/indus/model.hpp), so Q_LN,LN = 0.02 and Q_HN,HN = 0.04 give exactly the
* objective above.
*
* KKT, via the multiplier on the equality row: 0.02 LN = 0.04 HN, so LN = 2 HN. Substituting
* into LN + HN = 100 gives HN = 100/3, LN = 200/3. Neither bound is active, so this interior
* stationary point is the optimum: objective = 0.01*(200/3)^2 + 0.02*(100/3)^2 = 200/3, about
* 66.66667. Small enough to check with algebra alone - no numerical library, no INDUS-OPT code.
