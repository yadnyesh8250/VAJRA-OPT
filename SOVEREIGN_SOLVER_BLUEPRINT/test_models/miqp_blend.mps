* INDUS-OPT demo instance - a small convex MIQP (integer variables AND a quadratic objective).
*
* The same two-stream blend as demo/qp_blend.mps, with one change that moves it into a
* different problem class: throughput is now scheduled in WHOLE units rather than
* continuously. A refinery does not run a stream at 66.667 kbbl/day because the arithmetic
* says so - it runs an integer number of batches, tanks or campaign days - and the moment
* that is written down the problem is no longer a QP.
*
* minimize    0.01 LN^2 + 0.02 HN^2
* subject to  LN + HN = 100,   0 <= LN, HN <= 100,   LN and HN INTEGER
*
* HAND CHECK, by substitution - no solver, no numerical library:
*
*   The equality leaves one degree of freedom. Put LN = t, so HN = 100 - t, and
*
*     f(t) = 0.01 t^2 + 0.02 (100 - t)^2
*          = 0.01 t^2 + 0.02 (10000 - 200 t + t^2)
*          = 0.03 t^2 - 4 t + 200
*
*   which is a parabola minimised at t = 4 / 0.06 = 200/3 = 66.667, giving 200/3 = 66.66667.
*   That is the CONTINUOUS optimum, and it is not an integer, so the integer optimum is one
*   of its two neighbours:
*
*     f(66) = 0.03 (4356) - 264 + 200 = 130.68 - 64 = 66.68
*     f(67) = 0.03 (4489) - 268 + 200 = 134.67 - 68 = 66.67   <-- optimum
*
*   So the answer is LN = 67, HN = 33, objective 66.67, and the relaxation it came from is
*   66.66667. Those two numbers DIFFER, which is the point of the instance: a solver that
*   quietly dropped integrality would report 66.66667 and look entirely correct doing it.
*   Here the difference is visible at the fifth decimal, and the integer answer is provably
*   the better of exactly two candidates.
*
* QUADOBJ stores the lower triangle of Q and the objective is c'x + 0.5 x'Qx, so Q_ii of
* 0.02 and 0.04 give the 0.01 and 0.02 coefficients above - the same convention, and the
* same values, as demo/qp_blend.mps.
