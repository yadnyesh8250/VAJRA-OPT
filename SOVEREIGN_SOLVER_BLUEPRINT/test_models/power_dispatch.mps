* INDUS-OPT case study - power system dispatch (single-period unit commitment).
*
* PS26119 names 'power system dispatch' in scope. This is its smallest honest form:
* each generating unit has a marginal cost, a minimum stable generation level it
* cannot run below, a maximum, and a start-up cost paid only if it is committed.
* The min-stable-generation level is what makes this a MILP rather than an LP - a
* unit is either off, or on and producing AT LEAST its minimum.
*
*   min  sum_g ( c_g * p_g + s_g * u_g )
*   s.t. sum_g p_g = D                     (DEMAND, met exactly)
*        sum_g Pmax_g * u_g >= 1.15 * D    (RESERVE, spinning reserve margin)
*        p_g - Pmax_g * u_g <= 0           (CAPMX, off means zero)
*        p_g - Pmin_g * u_g >= 0           (CAPMN, on means at least Pmin)
*        u_g binary
*
*   D = 250 MW, reserve margin 1.15
*
*   unit   $/MWh   Pmin   Pmax   start-up
*   GA     10.0   20.0  100.0      100.0
*   GB     12.0   30.0  120.0       80.0
*   GC     20.0   10.0  150.0       50.0
*   GD      8.0   50.0   60.0      450.0
*
* GD is the trap, and the margin is deliberately thin. It burns the cheapest fuel on
* the system, so a merit-order rule commits it on sight. Doing so displaces 60 MW - 40
* from GB at 12 and 20 from GC at 20 - which saves 40*12 + 20*20 = 880 in fuel, against
* 60*8 + 450 = 930 to run and start it. Committing GD is therefore worse by exactly 50
* out of 3270, about 1.5%. At a start-up cost of 400 instead of 450 the two commitments
* TIE at 3270 while using completely different units, which is how this instance was
* found: the solver and the exhaustive oracle returned the same cost and disagreed on
* every unit. Alternate optima are normal in dispatch models and are the reason the
* oracle here compares the objective, not the assignment.
