* INDUS-OPT case study - product distribution from refineries to depots.
*
* PS26119 names 'transportation and supply chain management'. This is the classical
* balanced transportation problem, chosen because of a property it has BY
* CONSTRUCTION rather than by accident:
*
*   TOTAL SUPPLY EQUALS TOTAL DEMAND, so the seven equality rows are linearly
*   DEPENDENT - summing the three supply rows and summing the four demand rows give
*   the same equation. The constraint matrix has rank 6, not 7.
*
* That redundancy is why this instance is here. A simplex implementation that assumes
* its basis matrix is nonsingular, or an LU that cannot handle a structurally singular
* column, fails on it. Every vertex is also degenerate: a basis needs m + n - 1 = 6
* basic variables but the tableau has 7 rows, so at least one basic variable sits at
* zero at every iteration and ratio-test ties are the norm rather than the exception.
* This is the standard cycling test bed.
*
*   min  sum_ij f_ij x_ij
*   s.t. sum_j x_ij = supply_i    for each plant
*        sum_i x_ij = demand_j    for each depot
*
*   supply [300.0, 400.0, 500.0] = 1200
*   demand [250.0, 350.0, 400.0, 200.0] = 1200
*
*   freight cost per unit, plant (row) to depot (column):
*     MANGALORE  [4.0, 6.0, 9.0, 5.0]
*     KOCHI      [5.0, 3.0, 7.0, 8.0]
*     CHENNAI    [6.0, 7.0, 4.0, 3.0]
