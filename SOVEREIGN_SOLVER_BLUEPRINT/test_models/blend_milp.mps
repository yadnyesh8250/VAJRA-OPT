* INDUS-OPT demo instance - the crude blending model with a mode-switch binary.
*
* Same three crudes as demo/crude_blend.mps, plus one binary: whether the CDU runs in
* max-diesel mode. Running that mode costs 12 units of margin and relaxes the sulphur
* specification, which is the shape a real refinery scheduling model takes.
*
* THIS FILE IS EXPECTED TO BE REFUSED until Phase 5 lands branch and cut. Handing it to the
* LP engine and reporting the fractional relaxation as optimal is the single most damaging
* thing the dispatcher could do, so CI solves this instance on every pull request purely to
* confirm it comes back `not_solved` rather than with a plausible answer.
*
* MODE is the binary. Linked to the sulphur row by a big-M term: when MODE = 1 the sulphur
* constraint is slackened by 20 units.
