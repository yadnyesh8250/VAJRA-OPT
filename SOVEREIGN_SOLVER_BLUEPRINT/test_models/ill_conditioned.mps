* INDUS-OPT case study - the supply chain model, deliberately badly scaled.
*
* PS26119 asks for robustness on 'ill-conditioned constraint matrices'. The honest way
* to demonstrate that is on an instance WHOSE ANSWER IS ALREADY KNOWN, so the claim is
* falsifiable rather than a number nobody can check.
*
* This is data/casestudies/supply_chain.mps with row i multiplied by r_i and column j
* substituted x_j -> t_j * x'_j, the objective coefficient scaled to match:
*
*   row scales     10^-6 ... 10^+6
*   column scales  10^-6 ... 10^+4
*
* Both operations are exact re-parameterisations. The feasible set is the same set seen
* through a diagonal change of variables, so
*
*   THE OPTIMAL OBJECTIVE IS UNCHANGED, and    x'_j = x_j / t_j.
*
* Row and column scales COMPOUND, so the entries now span twenty-two orders of
* magnitude - 1e-10 to 1e+12 - and the 2-norm condition number is about 2e28. A solver
* that pivots on
* magnitude alone selects a numerically worthless pivot here, and a solver with no
* scaling declares it infeasible or unbounded. The demo solves both files and checks
* the two objectives agree - if they do not, we have a bug, and it shows.
