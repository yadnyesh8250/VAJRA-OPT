* INDUS-OPT case study - production planning by lot sizing.
*
* PS26119 asks for robustness on 'weak LP relaxations'. This is the textbook source of
* one. Producing in a period costs a fixed set-up charge no matter how little is made,
* and the only way to write that in a MILP is the big-M link
*
*       x_t <= M * y_t,     M = total demand over the horizon
*
* In the RELAXATION y_t is free to take the value x_t / M, so a period producing one
* unit pays 1/180 of a set-up instead of a whole one. The relaxation therefore buys the
* set-up structure at a fraction of its true price and its bound sits far below the
* integer optimum. Branch and bound has to close that gap by search.
*
*   min  sum_t ( 2 x_t + 150 y_t + 1 s_t )
*   s.t. s_{t-1} + x_t - s_t = d_t     (BAL, inventory balance, s_0 = 0)
*        x_t - M y_t <= 0              (LINK)
*        y_t binary
*
*   demand [40.0, 60.0, 30.0, 50.0], M = 180
*
* The demo reports the relaxation bound and the integer optimum side by side, so the
* size of the gap the search actually had to close is visible rather than asserted.
